IntroductionIdentifying ecological processes and detecting changes in biodiversity at broad spatial and temporal scales requires robust data gathered using standardized monitoring schemes over large spatial extent and over long time periods, respectively (Gregory et al. 2005, Carvarlheiro et al. 2013). However, such data are available for few taxa from a very limited number of sites. In recent years, opportunistically collected “citizen science data” (CSD) has emerged to be the next best source, which relies on volunteers using less structured protocols and has yielded high quantity of biodiversity records. Citizen science typically integrates public outreach and scientific data collection (Cooper et al. 2007, Irwin 2001). Participants are typically outdoor hobbyists are given access to learning material and protocols, gather data, enter them in some standardized format in centralized online databases (e.g. eBird), where they can additional view summaries using interactive visuals (graphs and maps). Increasingly, the immediate validation of observations and transmission of information is being facilitated through development of sophisticated internet and cell phone applications (Burke et al. 2006).
